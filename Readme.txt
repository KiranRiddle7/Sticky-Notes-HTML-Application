Hello There!!

This a Sticky notes application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript libraries. 
The application creates Sticky Notes kind of elements to store something like a To-Do list.
Each sticky note contains a Title and a description. 
The notes are saved in by making use of browsers local storage. (P.S if the browser doesn't support local storage. the application doesn't save the notes)
The application initially creates an empty note if no notes exist already in the local storage.
One can add any number of new notes to the the existing notes in the application by using 'Add' button and save them using 'Save' button.
One can also delete the existing notes if the notes are no longer useful.
Upon addition/deletion of a note, one needs to save the current state of notes in order to save them to the local storage.
The application also runs on a Standard mobile browser.
The application uses Google fonts and therefore for best experience Internet connectivity is recommended.
The application works best on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox Browsers.
